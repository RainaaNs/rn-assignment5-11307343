## Transactedd - Finance Manager App

## How I Built the App:
This project is a React Native application designed to help users manage their personal finances. I made it such that it features a user-friendly interface that allows users to view their profile, check their financial cards, send and receive money, and review their recent transactions. I also added a toggle feature such that the app supports both light and dark themes, through the use of context api.

This covers the Front-end aspect only.

## Key Features:

### User Profile:
This displays the user's profile picture and a welcome text.
It includes a search function for quick access to financial data.

### Financial Cards:
This section shows a card with an overview of the user's financial status.

### Quick Actions:
These four actions allow users to quickly send and receive money, apply for loans, and top up their accounts.

### Recent Transactions:
This section displays a list of recent transactions with details such as the merchant name, category, and transaction amount.
Transactions are categorized into entertainment, music, transfers, and expenses.

### Theming:
Supports both light and dark themes, adapting the UI based on user preference.
### Context API: 
For state management, specifically to handle theme toggling.
### Custom Styles: 
Uses StyleSheet from React Native for consistent styling across components.

Last but not the least:
### React Native: 
For building the cross-platform mobile application.

### Usage:
The app is intended for users who want to keep track of their financial activities in a simple and efficient manner. The intuitive UI and quick access features make it ideal for everyday use, ensuring users can manage their finances on the go.
